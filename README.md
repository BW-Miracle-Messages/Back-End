## Purpose 

This API was created for the app Miracle Messages. Miracle Messages allows volunteers to post a 
missing person looking to reconnect with their family members. Each missing person is considered a case. 
A volunteer can have more than one case and a case can have more than one family member. 

## Getting Started

Git clone the repo to your computer.

In the terminal type the following commands:
  - npm install or npm i (to download node modules)
  - npm run server (to start server)
  
 Happy Coding!
